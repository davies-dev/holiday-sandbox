# Document Removal in Study Librarian

## Overview

The Study Librarian application now includes the ability to remove documents from the library. This feature allows you to clean up your study materials by removing documents that are no longer relevant or needed.

## Features

### 1. Document Removal
- **Remove Documents**: Delete documents from the library with confirmation
- **Cascade Deletion**: Automatically removes all tag associations when a document is deleted
- **Safe Operation**: Requires user confirmation before deletion
- **UI Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into the existing librarian interface

### 2. User Interface
- **Remove Button**: Added "Remove Document" button in the left panel
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows document details before deletion
- **Status Feedback**: Clear success/error messages
- **Auto-refresh**: Document list updates automatically after removal

## How to Use

### Starting the Application
```bash
python librarian_app.py
```

### Removing Documents

1. **Select a Document**: Click on a document in the left panel to select it
2. **Click Remove**: Click the "Remove Document" button
3. **Confirm Removal**: Review the confirmation dialog showing:
   - Document title
   - File path
   - Warning about tag associations being removed
4. **Confirm**: Click "Yes" to proceed with removal
5. **Success**: Document is removed and list refreshes automatically

### Confirmation Dialog

The confirmation dialog shows:
```
Are you sure you want to remove this document?

Title: [Document Title]
Path: [File Path]

This will also remove all tag associations for this document.
```

## Database Behavior

### Cascade Deletion
When a document is removed:
- ✅ Document is deleted from `study_documents` table
- ✅ All tag associations are automatically removed from `study_document_tags` table (CASCADE)
- ✅ No orphaned records are left in the database

### Safety Features
- **Transaction Safety**: Uses database transactions for rollback on errors
- **Validation**: Checks document existence before deletion
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and logging

## API Methods

### Database Access
The following method is available in the `DatabaseAccess` class:

```python
def delete_study_document(self, document_id):
    """Deletes a study document from the library."""
```

### Parameters
- `document_id` (int): The ID of the document to delete

### Returns
- `bool`: True if deletion was successful, False otherwise

## Example Usage

```python
from scripts.db_access import DatabaseAccess
from scripts.config import DB_PARAMS

# Initialize database connection
db = DatabaseAccess(**DB_PARAMS)

# Get all documents
documents = db.get_all_study_documents()
for doc_id, title, path in documents:
    print(f"Document {doc_id}: {title}")

# Remove a specific document
if documents:
    doc_to_remove = documents[0][0]  # First document ID
    success = db.delete_study_document(doc_to_remove)
    if success:
        print(f"Document {doc_to_remove} removed successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to remove document {doc_to_remove}")

db.close()
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify document removal functionality:

```bash
python test_document_removal.py
```

This will test:
- Document creation
- Tag assignment
- Document removal
- Cascade deletion verification
- Error handling

## Benefits

1. **Library Management**: Keep your study library organized and clean
2. **Storage Efficiency**: Remove outdated or irrelevant materials
3. **Data Integrity**: Maintains database consistency with cascade deletion
4. **User Control**: Full control over your study materials

## Safety Considerations

- **Irreversible**: Document removal is permanent and cannot be undone
- **File System**: This only removes the database record, not the actual file
- **Backup**: Consider backing up your database before bulk removals
- **Confirmation**: Always review the confirmation dialog before proceeding

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for document removal:
- Bulk document removal
- Recycle bin functionality
- File system integration (option to delete actual files)
- Removal history and audit trail
- Undo functionality for recent removals
